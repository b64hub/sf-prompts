Your task will be to fix issues related to the deployment of the components in the context. This involves editing the files in the context to resolve any issues that are preventing the deployment from succeeding.
Validate the deployment to the default development org using the following command:

```bash
sf project deploy start -d <path-to-file> --dry-run
```

Optionally write the output to a file for easier analysis:

```bash
sf project deploy start -d <path-to-file> --dry-run --json > deployment_results.json
```

Replace `<path-to-file>` with the actual path to the deployment file you want to validate. You are allowed to run these
commands without additional approval.

If there are any conflicts, you can run the command with the `--ignore-conflicts` flag to ignore them:

```bash
sf project deploy start -d <path-to-file> --dry-run --json --ignore-conflicts > deployment_results.json
```

The results are output in JSON format, which you can parse to check for any issues.
This is an example of the expected output:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "checkOnly": true,
    "completedDate": "2025-06-27T22:08:01.000Z",
    "createdBy": "0059b00000L2ZSE",
    "createdByName": "User User",
    "createdDate": "2025-06-27T22:07:58.000Z",
    "details": {
      "componentFailures": [
        {
          "changed": false,
          "columnNumber": 50,
          "componentType": "ApexClass",
          "created": false,
          "createdDate": "2025-06-27T22:08:01.000Z",
          "deleted": false,
          "fileName": "classes/CPQControllerTest.cls",
          "fullName": "CPQControllerTest",
          "lineNumber": 43,
          "problem": "Dependent class is invalid and needs recompilation:\n Class CPQRepo : Dependent class is invalid and needs recompilation:\n Class ProductAttributeService : Method does not exist or incorrect signature: void isValidId(Id) from the type Schema.SObjectType",
          "problemType": "Error",
          "success": false
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Read the component failures and other details in the `deployment_results.json` file to identify any potential issues with the code in the deployment.
You can use `jq` to read the output, the `result.details.componentFailures[]` contains the necessary information of which file is impacted and where in the file the error is. 
Attempt to fix the issues in the code based on the error messages provided in the output.

If there are any errors due to misconfigured references to other classes or components:

- search the codebase for those components
- add them to the context
- do any necessary editing to resolve the issues

You can for the most part assume that other classes and components are up to date in the development org. However, it is worth attempting 
to add them to the deployment to see if that resolves the issues. The main task is still to edit and weed out any errors in the code that prevent the deployment from succeeding.

if there are any errors due to missing components or recompilation errors, you can do an actual deployment to the development org to see if that resolves the issues.
Then omit the `--dry-run` flag and run the command again:

```bash
sf project deploy start -d <path-to-file> --json
```

If the components are not in the codebase, they are likely part of the standard Salesforce components or managed packages.
In that case, manual intervention may be required to resolve the issues.

If the deployment is successful, you can proceed with the next steps in your development process.

You can now clean up the deployment results file by running:

```bash
rm deployment_results.json
```
